# DBDeployments
This repository supports changes for the Database Deployment Methods Demystified Session

Abstract:
If you had to describe the database deployment process, you may say: We make changes in dev, magic happens, and then they appear in production. The technical part of that magic is what we’ll discuss.

In this session, we will explore the different ways that database changes can be applied - state based or migration scripts. We’ll look at how this impacts the various parts of the development lifecycle. We’ll examine some of the unexpected implications of how we deploy changes, including source control and database projects. This session isn’t just about implementing DevOps but about technical considerations regardless of how you deploy changes.

By the end of this session, you should have a clear understanding of the different ways to deploy your database changes, how they work, and most importantly, why you may want to implement those options.
